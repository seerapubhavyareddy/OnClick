## Project Architecture Overview

Based on the requirements, here's what we need to build:

**Core Features:**
1. Google OAuth for calendar integration
2. Multiple Google account support
3. Calendar event display with toggle switches
4. Recall.ai integration for meeting recording
5. Meeting transcript processing
6. AI-powered content generation
7. Social media OAuth (LinkedIn, Facebook)
8. Post scheduling and publishing
9. Settings and automation configuration

## Recommended Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Next.js 14 with TypeScript
**Backend:** Next.js API routes
**Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

Would you like me to start by creating the initial project structure and database schema? I can provide you with the complete code for each component as we go through this systematically.

Also, do you have access to:
- Recall.ai API key
- OpenAI API key
- LinkedIn/Facebook developer accounts for OAuth setup

Let me know and I'll begin with the foundational code!
